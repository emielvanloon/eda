Exploratory Data Analysis in R
</p>

<p style="color: #595959;margin-top:10px;">
This repo houses lecture notes used in an *Exploratory Data Analysis in R* course taught to undergraduates at Colby College. The course assumes little to no background in quantitative analysis nor in computer programming and was first taught in Spring, 2015. The course introduces students to data manipulation in R, data exploration (in the spirit of John Tukey's EDA) and the R markdown language. Many of the visualization tools are adopted from William Cleveland's *Data Visualization* book.
